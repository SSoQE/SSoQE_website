Pre-workshop technical instructions for participants.
Let's get ready to rock!
🚀

## R and RStudio 💻

[R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) is a fantastic software for statistical analyses.
📊 [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) is your trusty sidekick, helping you navigate the R universe with ease.
It's like a cozy integrated development environment (IDE) for R.
🌟

There are plenty of guides available to help you obtain or update R and RStudio.
Here are a couple of them to get you started:

-   [R Basics for Paleoecologists](https://ckiahtipes.github.io/) by C.A. Kiahtipes, a previous part of the APD series of workshops.
-   [Install or Update R tutorial](https://jennhuck.github.io/workshops/install_update_R.html) by Jennifer Huck.

```{r}
#| label: chunk-setup
#| include: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

## Git and GitHub 🌐

Please follow the tutorial [here](https://ondrejmottl.github.io/VersionControl_gitHell/) to install Git and set up a GitHub account.

Specifically, we will be using Git, GitHub, and RStudio for version control and collaboration during the workshop.
🤝

## Packages 📦

Packages are like magic toolboxes 🧰 that contain a collection of functions for specific needs.
We want to make sure that everyone has the necessary packages installed for this workshop.

### Install packages

Let's create a list of packages that we'll need from CRAN.
Here they are:

```{r}
#| label: chunk-pkg-list
#| output: false 
#| warning: false
#| message: false
package_list <-
  c(
    "ape",
    "fs",
    "geiger",
    "geojsonsf",
    "here",
    "httpgd",
    "janitor",
    "jsonlite",
    "knitr",
    "languageserver",
    "neotoma2",
    "palmerpenguins",
    "phytools",
    "picante",
    "quarto",
    "renv",
    "remotes",
    "rlang",
    "sdm",
    "targets",
    "terra",
    "tidyverse",
    "tinytable",
    "usethis",
    "utils",
    "visNetwork",
    "torch",
    "cito",
    "vegan"
  )
```

Now, let's install all these amazing packages from CRAN:

```{r}
#| label: chunk-pkg-install
#| eval: false
lapply(
  package_list, utils::install.packages
)
```

### Test if all packages are ready ✅

Let's do a quick test to make sure everything is in order.
Running the following code should produce `"Everything is good to go"` instead of an error message saying `"All required packages are not installed"`.

```{r}
#| label: chunk-pkg-test
#| eval: false
if (
  isTRUE(
    all(
      package_list %in%
        as.data.frame(
          utils::installed.packages()
        )[, 1]
    )
  )
) {
  cat("Everything is good to go")
} else {
  warning("All required packages are not installed")
  warning(
    paste(
      "Please install the following packages:",
      paste(
        setdiff(
          package_list,
          as.data.frame(
            utils::installed.packages()
          )[, 1]
        ),
        collapse = ", "
      )
    )
  )
}
```

## Getting the workshop materials 📚

You can download the workshop materials from the [GitHub repositoris](https://github.com/orgs/SSoQE/repositories).

Just find wanted repository and then on the right side, should be `Releases`, where you will be able to download the ZIP file📦.

### Private repositories

Some of the materials might be not be made for general public (and therefore publically available).
In that case, you will need to have access to the repository, which we can grant you.

1.  Go to the [this Discussion thread](https://github.com/orgs/SSoQE/discussions/9) and comment with your GitHub username.
2.  Await for the organizors to grant you access to the repository.
3.  Check your email. You should receive an email with the invitation to the SSoQE.
4.  You will now be able to access private repositories and download the materials.
