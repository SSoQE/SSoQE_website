## Accommodation and Food 🏡 🍲 
### ❗ Deadline **27.07.2025**
If you haven't filled out [the food and accommodation poll](https://forms.gle/oSraSPdDjw4b34uW6) yet, please do so **now**, so we can provide the house staff with the necessary information.

## Reimbursement 📝 💸 
### ❗ Deadline **01.09.2025**
To be able to receive the reimbursement, you are going to need a **German tax ID**. If you have ever worked in Germany, you already have a tax ID, if not, you will need to apply for one. The reimbursement scheme follows rigid rules that you should consider first:

- Travels by car 🚗 : Only the driver will be reimbursed for the fuel costs with 0.40 €/km in case of convincing reasons and 0.25€/km in case of not convincing reasons. We will try to claim convincing reasons which are saving time and car pooling, but don't know if they will be accepted.
- Flight ✈️ and train 🚂 tickets can only be reimbursed for economy class / 2nd class. You will need to hand in the original bills. 

We estimate that we can reimburse travel costs up to 50€ per person. However, the explained rules may lead to less reimbursed costs. 
To get a German tax ID, you will need to fill [the following (German) online form](https://www.finanzamt.bayern.de/Informationen/Formulare/fms.php?n=010250)

**Please follow the [PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J885X4cGAEz13_WNpKgfNEx17FofJNrQ) attached to the email** and fill the form accordingly, to make sure no required information is missing.
**Please make sure to apply for your tax ID asap, so we will get it in time!**

After filling in the form, please send the filled PDF and a scan of your ID card or passport to the following email address: *poststelle.fa-bt(at)finanzamt.bayern.de*. 📧 
We provide you with a template for the email after this explanation. Please also include Franka's (*franka.gaiser(at)uni-bayreuth.de*) and Wanda's (*wanda.witte(at)uni-bayreuth.de*) email addresses in the CC, so we can help you out in case of any further questions. 

Don't hesitate to reach out if anything regarding this form should still be unclear!
