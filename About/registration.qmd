### Information for Charles University students 

Here, how you can currently get in as a student from Charles University:

**1) SIS Course Registration**

  * The best route is via the SIS course [MB120C28: Science School on Quantitative  Ecology](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=MB120C28). Unfortunately, the registration period for the summer semester 2025 is already closed, so you'll need to request late registration via the Student Affairs office. You can use this [general request template](https://natur.cuni.cz/en/students/forms-of-study/for-students/general-request).
  
  * ‼️**Please note that all slots in SIS are currently filled** - but don't worry! You can still register and be placed on the waiting list. If someone withdraws, you'll have a chance to jump in.

**2) Wildcard Application**

  * You can also apply as a "*wildcard*" (i.e. [student from another university](/About/registration.qmd#students-from-other-universities-(🌍))). Just follow the instructions below. Applications are open until **6 May 2025**, and the selection committee will review all wildcard applications in May.

To maximise your chances, we recommend doing both!
:::

## 2. Students from other universities - *wildcard* (🌍)

Register via our [application form](https://forms.gle/UEoxmgjoqJ8Q9j7p7) until **Tuesday, 06.05.2025**

There is a limited number of places for students from other universities. 

A successful registration will be confirmed by an automatic copy of the filled form to your stated email address. This confirmation **is no acception**. The selection of participants will be done by the organizing committee. Please do not expect a response on your application status during May.  

In case of urgent questions, please contact: ssoqe@natur.cuni.cz (with your name in the subject).

## Credits and Certificates 📜

After the course, each participant will be eligible for:

1.  **Certificate of Attendance** validated by the University of Bayreuth and Charles University
2.  **Credits**: If you are a student of either of the two hosting universities, you will receive credits for the course. The number of credits will be determined by your home university.

## Cancelation Policy ❌

In case of acceptance to the science school, we expect a binding confirmation of participation.
If no longer interested, we kindly ask you to inform us promptly as a spontaneous cancellation leads to the forfeiture of the place and other students no longer have the opportunity to participate in the Science School.
Furthermore, additional costs and administrative work arise for us in case of spontaneous cancellation.
