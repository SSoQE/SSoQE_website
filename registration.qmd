## Cancelation Policy ❌

In case of acceptance to the science school, we expect a binding confirmation of participation by the end of July. If no longer interested, we kindly ask you to inform us promptly as a spontaneous cancellation leads to the forfeiture of the place and other students no longer have the opportunity to participate in the Science School. Furthermore, additional costs and administrative work arise for us in case of spontaneous cancellation.
