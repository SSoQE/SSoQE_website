Hence, we believe that handling big data adequately and being able to analyse it with rigourous quantitative methods are essential skills to finish your studies in ecology successfully and to pursue a career in ecology. That’s why in 2024, we are offering for the first time a joint science school between the Charles University in Prague (CZ) and the University of Bayreuth (GER) on Quantitative Ecology for master as well as PhD students. This website will be used as official communication tool. Right now, you can find the first preliminary information on the event and how to sign up for it.
