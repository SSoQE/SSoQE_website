If you want to drive a car and want to share the ride with other participants, please let us know in advance.\n\nArrival and Departure 🚆🚍:\nYour arrival date is Monday, 23rd September 2024. Ideally, plan to arrive in Bayreuth by train at 13:00 PM. We have arranged a shuttle service that will take you from Bayreuth to Wallenfels at 13:15. Still, you can also come directly to Wallenfells (Universität Bayreuth Ökologische Außenstelle, Am Allerswald 1, 96346 Wallenfels).\nWe will depart from Wallenfels in the afternoon on Saturday, 28th September 2024. We should be able to leave at the latest at 13:30 in Wallenfels and thus, be back in Bayreuth around 14:30. A shuttle service will be available again. Please plan your travels and book your tickets accordingly.\n\n\nTravelling from the Czech Republic 🇨🇿➡️🇩🇪:\nIf you are traveling from the Czech Republic by public transport, we find out that the only feasible option is by train. To make it cheaper, you need to buy tickets from České Dráhy and Deutsche Bahn separately.\nRecommended train connections for arrival 23.09.:\n\nČeské Dráhy:\n\n08:23 - 11:27 from Prague main train station to Cheb by IC 564 Západní expres\n\nDeutsche Bahn\n\n11:34 - 11:57 from Cheb to Marktredwitz by RE 33\n12:07 - 12:24 from Marktredwitz to Kirchenlaibach by RE 31\n12:42 - 12:58from Kirchenlaibach to Bayreuth by ag RB34\n\n\nRecommended train connections for departure 28.09.:\n\nDeutsche Bahn\n\n15:01 - 15:15 from Bayreuth to Kirchenlaibach by ag RB34\n15:34 - 15:51 from Kirchenlaibach to Marktredwitz by RE 31\n16:03 - 16:24from Marktredwitz to Cheb by RE 33\n\nČeské Dráhy\n\n16:33 - 19:23 from Cheb to Prague main train station by IC 563 Západní expres\n\n\n\n\nReimbursement of travel costs 💸:\nPlease keep all invoices for your travel expenses. We can reimburse them at least partially - the exact amount depends on the overall costs. The cost of the train for CZ participants should be around 80 EUR in total (50 EUR + 748 CZK).
