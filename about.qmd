## General information 📚
Get ready to dive deep into the fascinating world of ecology! Our [diverse team of instructors](team.qmd), who are active researchers in various ecological subdisciplines, will guide you through both theoretical and practical aspects of the course. Here's what you can expect:

* **Engaging Lectures**🔬: Drawn directly from the instructors' current research projects, ensuring you learn the most up-to-date information.
* **Hands-On Practice**🤝: Sharpen your skills with practical exercises in R, tailored to help you tackle real-world data challenges.
* **Social Events**😊: From barbecues to informal gatherings, you'll have plenty of opportunities to relax, network, and forge new friendships with fellow participants. 

## Course Content 🎯

::: {.callout-tip}
### What to expect
Dive into a diverse range of exciting subjects designed to empower you with advanced ecological analysis skills and a deep understanding of the environment. By the end of this course, you'll be equipped to tackle pressing ecological questions such as:

* 🌐 **Quantitative Ecology Fundamentals**: Understand why we use quantitative analysis in ecology, exploring the differences between data exploration, inference, and prediction.
* 🛠️ **Mastering Project Management**: Gain proficiency in managing large, reproducible ecological projects with tools like Git/GitHub, and learn the art of clean coding and effective project planning.
* 🌿 **Plant Taxonomy Deep Dive**: Gain a comprehensive overview of resources regarding plant taxonomy, occurrences, and traits, essential for accurate (paleo)ecological research.
* 🌱 **From Past to Present**: Seamlessly integrate paleoecological data with current plant species data to uncover ecological trends. Learn to address macro-ecological questions using paleontological data, connecting ancient life with today's plant species.
* 🌍 **Evolution of Ecological Patterns**: Delve into (paleo)ecological patterns on grand scales to study the processes that have shaped life on Earth over millions of years with the help of phylogenies.
:::

Additional Topics We Might Cover:

* 💻 Coding for Ecologists: Enhance your coding skills in R for a variety of applications from functional programming to developing R packages.
* 🎲 Statistical Sophistication: Get to grips with Bayesian basics, causal inference, multivariate analysis, and advanced modeling techniques like hierarchical models.
* 🤖 Tech Meets (Paleo)Ecology: Explore the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, AI, and remote sensing in (paleo)ecological research.
