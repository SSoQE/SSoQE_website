Hop over to the [Travel channel on our GitHub forum](https://github.com/SSoQE/SSoQE-Forum/discussions/categories/travel) to self-organise car-sharing and/od ask about travel options.

To join in the fun, you'll need a GitHub account. No worries if you don't have one yet-check out this [easy tutorial to get started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github). Hot tip: Use your university or scientific institution email to get some cool student perks!

Inside the forum, you'll also find different channels to keep things organised: Questions, Travel, and Offtopic (because we all need a place for memes, right?).
