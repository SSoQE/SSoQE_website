Pre-workshop technical instructions for participants. Let's get ready to rock! 🚀

## R and RStudio 💻

[R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) is a fantastic software for statistical analyses. 📊 [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) is your trusty sidekick, helping you navigate the R universe with ease. It's like a cozy integrated development environment (IDE) for R. 🌟

There are plenty of guides available to help you obtain or update R and RStudio. Here are a couple of them to get you started:

- [R Basics for Paleoecologists](https://ckiahtipes.github.io/) by C.A. Kiahtipes, a previous part of the APD series of workshops. 
- [Install or Update R tutorial](https://jennhuck.github.io/workshops/install_update_R.html) by Jennifer Huck. 

```{r}
#| label: chunk-setup
#| include: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

## Git and GitHub 🌐

Please follow the tutorial [here](https://ondrejmottl.github.io/VersionControl_gitHell/) to install Git and set up a GitHub account.

Specifically, we will be using Git, GitHub, and RStudio for version control and collaboration during the workshop. 🤝

## Packages 📦

Packages are like magic toolboxes 🧰 that contain a collection of functions for specific needs. We want to make sure that everyone has the necessary packages installed for this workshop.

### Install packages 

Let's create a list of packages that we'll need from CRAN. Here they are:

```{r}
#| label: chunk-pkg-list
#| output: false 
#| warning: false
#| message: false
package_list <-
  c(
    "ape",
    "fs",
    "geiger",
    "geojsonsf",
    "here",
    "httpgd",
    "janitor",
    "jsonlite",
    "knitr",
    "languageserver",
    "neotoma2",
    "palmerpenguins",
    "phytools",
    "picante",
    "quarto",
    "renv",
    "remotes",
    "rlang",
    "sdm",
    "targets",
    "terra",
    "tidyverse",
    "tinytable",
    "usethis",
    "utils",
    "visNetwork",
    "torch",
    "cito",
    "vegan"
  )
```

Now, let's install all these amazing packages from CRAN:

```{r}
#| label: chunk-pkg-install
#| eval: false
lapply(
  package_list, utils::install.packages
)
```


### Test if all packages are ready ✅

Let's do a quick test to make sure everything is in order. Running the following code should produce `"Everything is good to go"` instead of an error message saying `"All required packages are not installed"`.

```{r}
#| label: chunk-pkg-test
#| eval: false
if (
  isTRUE(
    all(
      package_list %in%
        as.data.frame(
          utils::installed.packages()
        )[, 1]
    )
  )
) {
  cat("Everything is good to go")
} else {
  warning("All required packages are not installed")
  warning(
    paste(
      "Please install the following packages:",
      paste(
        setdiff(
          package_list,
          as.data.frame(
            utils::installed.packages()
          )[, 1]
        ),
        collapse = ", "
      )
    )
  )
}
```
